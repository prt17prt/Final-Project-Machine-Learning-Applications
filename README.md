## 1. Introduction

In this project, we aim to analyze and understand the thematic structure and popularity patterns of Reddit posts related to sports. Reddit, as one of the most widely used platforms for online discussion, offers great user-generated content across numerous communities (subreddits), particularly those dedicated to sports like football, basketball, or tennis. In order to achieve this, we used some of the tools explained in class about Machine learning tools and Natural Language Processing.

## 2. Task 1: Text Preprocessing and vectorization

## 3. Task 2: Recommender Systems

## 4. Dashboard

In this section, we have developed an interactive Dashboard using Dash. This dashboard includes several interactive components for exploring and analyzing the topics discussed in Reddit posts about sports. Here are the main features:

#### 1. Word Cloud for the Selected Date Range
We’ve added a date range selector that lets you choose a specific time period. The word cloud will then generate based on the titles of Reddit posts within that date range. You can also filter the word cloud by sport, allowing you to see how popular words evolve over time within the chosen sport.

#### 2. Topic Distribution by Highlighted Event
This section allows you to explore topics related to significant events within a sport. You can select a sport and a major event (we have slected them), and the dashboard will generate a word cloud of the most mentioned words around that event, from the date of the event to two weeks after the event. This feature is useful for analyzing how major events influence the topics discussed by users.

#### 3. Topic Distribution by Sport
A dropdown selector allows you to choose a sport (e.g., football, basketball) and view a bar chart showing the distribution of topics (LDA) that are most prominent in Reddit posts related to that sport. This chart helps visualize how certain topics are more common in specific sports, which is useful for understanding trends and user interests in different sports.

#### 4. Evolution of Popularity for Famous Athletes
We have included a graph showing the monthly evolution of mentions for famous athletes on Reddit. You can select one or more athletes (e.g., Messi, LeBron James - we added 3 important athletes for each sport), and the graph will show how their mentions have changed month by month. This chart helps visualize fluctuations in user interest over time for different athletes.
